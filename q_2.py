################################# Question 2 ###################################
#
# Write a function called calculate_overtime that takes two parameters -- a pay
# rate ($ / hr) and the number of hours worked -- and returns the pay. Any hours
# over 40 are paid at time and a half.

def calculate_overtime(pay_rate, n_hours):
    """Calculate an employee's pay, taking account of overtime pay.
    
    `pay_rate` pay rate in dollars per hour
    `n_hours` number of hours worked in a particular week"""
    # REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR CODE:
    pass

print(calculate_overtime(10, 42)) # This should be 440
