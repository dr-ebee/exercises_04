################################# Question 3 ###################################
#
# Write a function called check_leap_year that one parameter -- year -- and
# returns True if the year is a leap year and False if it's not.
#
# HINT:
# (from Wikipedia)
# Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years
# that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if
# they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900
# are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.

def check_leap_year(year):
    """WRITE DOC STRING"""
    # REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR CODE:
    pass

# WRITE SOME TESTS
# (HINT: you can use this list https://www.calendar.best/leap-years.html)
